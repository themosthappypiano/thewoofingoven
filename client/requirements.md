## Packages
zustand | Lightweight state management for the shopping cart
react-hook-form | Form state management
@hookform/resolvers | Zod validation for forms

## Notes
- Using Zustand for client-side cart state
- Assuming backend routes match the provided API contract exactly (/api/products, /api/reviews, /api/checkout, /api/contact)
- Tailwind config needs to be updated to support the custom fonts (Fredoka and Poppins) if not already configured, but we will use CSS variables directly as instructed.
